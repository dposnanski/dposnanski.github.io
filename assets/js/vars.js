/*var questions = [
  {
    q: "What inspired you to become a web developer?",
    a: "I had made a couple of personal websites back when I was 16 and I really enjoyed it. I remember a lot of sleepless nights playing around with the code trying to make it look exactly how I wanted it to. I studied programming on my last high-school semester but then, I went on to college and studied a completely different thing. I ended up working at Costumer Service, Translation and Tourism related companies. I really liked translation, but I remembered those days when I was a teenager and how passionate I was about making my websites. I had made an online store with Prestashop and then moved it to Wordpress, and I remembered my teenage years, and building websites with passion. So I then decided it was the path I wanted to take!"

  {
    q: "What kind of projects do you like to work on?",
    a: "I like to work on creative, beautiful projects that make the world a better place. Be it making people feel happy through humor, giving people the chance to store and share their memories, informing and educating them, aiding other people, helping animals, you name it!"
  },
  {
    q: "What do you need in order to start working on a project?",
    a: "For translation related services: I would need the document, movie, website or project you need translated and the preferred delivery date. For web development services: I would need to know what kind of website I'd be developing and which content you would like to publish. Is it a photography portfolio website? An online store? A landing page? A blog? If you have an idea of the sections on your website, along with the content and pictures, that would be great!"
  },
  {
    q: "What is your preferred communication method and how often do you keep in touch while working on a project?",
    a: "I find written communication forms to be better, I prefer email and WhatsApp, we can Skype to arrange the details of the project though. I like having everything documented so I can look back, review and double check projects :-) We would arrange milestone projects, and, depending on the project's length and complexity, I'd keep you up to date at least once a week."
  },
  {
    q: "What is your average project turnaround?",
    a: "It really depends on the complexity of the project, but, if you provide me with all the necessary information, pictures and content from the start, it will go a lot faster :-) My estimate is around one week."
